<div id="python-basics" class="section level1">
<h1>Python Basics</h1>
<p>When it comes to R versus Python, both languages can be quite useful. Compared to R, Python appears sleeker, operates faster, and its libraries can be a bit more difficult to run. In addition, Python documentation is limited but this language still remains more popular than R. The core Python data science stack includes Matplotlib, Numpy, and Jupyter among others. While Python can be used with Jupyterhub on the educcomp severs, it can also be used in R Studio.</p>
<p>A simple example of assignment in Python is presented below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>three = 3
two = 2
two + three
## [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>One function that is particularly useful is using the symbol &quot;_&quot; to represent the last value that was printed. This is similar to using “.Last.value” in R.</p>
